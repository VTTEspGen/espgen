## Caveats and Thanks
This is just a re-skin of the DND5E Module For Foundry https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/dnd5e

I'm just a guy who has been asked to make a compatible character sheet. I have left all of the other 5E SRD Content and Rules in place, so I do not violate any of Alligator Alley's terms/copyrights.

I have left the original git structure in place so that you can see what has changed between this and the DND5E sheet. In short, I just changed the skill names for the actors.

Please feel free to contribute or fork, but this is likely as far as I will take it.

Thanks to the Foundry Team and Atropos for making awesome things!
